# industrial-anamaly-detection
Unsupervised anomaly detection for industrial inspection using a convolutional autoencoder on the MVTec Bottle dataset. Includes image-level ROC–AUC analysis, threshold selection, alternative anomaly scoring (mean vs max error), and pixel-level localization with IoU evaluation against ground-truth masks.
